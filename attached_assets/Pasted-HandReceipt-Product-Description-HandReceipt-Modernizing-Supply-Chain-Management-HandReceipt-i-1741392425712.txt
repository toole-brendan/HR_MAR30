HandReceipt Product Description

**HandReceipt: Modernizing Supply Chain Management**

HandReceipt is a blockchain-powered inventory and supply chain management solution that streamlines property tracking and transfers.

**Military Application:**
HandReceipt digitizes the currently paper-based process of equipment transfers between military personnel. Using scannable QR codes linked to blockchain-secured digital records, we make property accountability simple, reliable, and auditable. Seeks to implement best practices and advantages enabled by private sector systems like SAP, NetSuite, Oracle, and Microsoft Dynamics.

**Key Benefits:**
- Secure digital property records that can't be altered
- Simple QR-code scanning for transfers and verification (user uses mobile app to scan a QR code on property or inventory to initiate a transfer request, counterparty who currently in possession of (or is assigned) that piece of property receives notification of transfer request which they can either accept or decline)
- Reduced paperwork and manual processes
- Transparent tracking throughout the supply chain
- Sensitive item visibility 
- Reports and analytics
- Officers having full visibility into their unit’s property status
- Easing PCS moves and personnel swaps (leading to property swaps)
- Integrate with CIF 
- Ability to spot shortages
- Easing ammo draws and ammo accountability
- QR code management and ‘digital twin’ management (QR code assigned to property), able to report damaged QR codes and able to print out new ones
